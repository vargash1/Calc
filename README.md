#Calculator
This is a simple cli calculator that arose from my development of the cli bitwise calculator. Numeric arguments can be passed in decimal form. You can choose to output results in multiple radixes but this is not useful if you're doing floating point precision operations. This is intended to be a simple CLI tool to do a range of computations quickly. After peforming the inital operation, you have the choice of using the result with another operation of your choice.

###Usage
```bash
	#either are acceptable as it depends on your operation
	calc [FLAGS] [NUMERIC] [OPERATION] [NUMERIC]
	calc [FLAGS] [NUMERIC] [OPERATION] 
```
###Flags
* n will disable colorized output
* r will enable output of different radixes

###Operations
* Addition 
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Sqaure Root
* Cube Root
* Nth Root
* Percent Of
* Power to
* Modulus

###Installation
```bash
	#you may need to use sudo
	gem install calc

```
